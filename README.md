Using npm/bower/gulp to make sense of jquery validation when using locales

This repo can be used to create a globalize.js file using a specific locale together with jquery.validate to make date and number parsing work in a more predictable way.

Based on https://github.com/johnnyreilly/jquery-validation-globalize and his blog https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/

#Requires:
* npm
* bower
* gulp

Getting it working:
* Clone repo
* npm install
* bower install
* edit gulpfile.js and set locale to the desired one
* gulp
* To verify set the same locale in index.html and run npm start
